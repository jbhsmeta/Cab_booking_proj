Cab booking system is the process where renting a cab is automated through an app throughout a city. 
Using this app, people can book a cab from one location to another location. 
Being a cab booking app company, exploiting the understanding of cab supply and demand could increase the efficiency of their service and enhance user experience by minimizing waiting time.
Objective of this project is to combine historical usage pattern along with the open data sources like weather data to forecast cab booking demand in a city.

Following are the tasks, which need to be developed while executing the project:
Task 1:
1. Visualize data using different visualizations to generate interesting insights.
2. Outlier Analysis
3. Missing value analysis
4. Visualizing Total_booking Vs other features to generate insights
5. Correlation Analysis

Task 2:
1. Feature Engineering
2. Grid search
3. Regression Analysis
4. Ensemble Model
